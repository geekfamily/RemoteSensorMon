Remote Sensor Monitor
=====================

An Arduino/Raspberry PI remote sensor integration

This project is part of a site that I built for the more maker type projects I work on.  It will allow you to see how I got a Raspberry PI hosting a Node web server to use an Anrduino to monitor and report on the state of sensors.

Requirements
------------
*  Raspberry PI (model B)
*  Arduino
*  PIR Motion Sensor
*  LED
*  USB Cable
*  SD Card (for Raspberry PI)

Hardware Installation
---------------------


Software Installation
---------------------

1. Grab the code by whatever means suits you
2. Now run the project:

        node server.js
